Description:
----------------------------------
Fast Track Sites developed the Fast Track Sites Client Management System (FTSCLMS) to allow company owners to easily track their daily meetings as well as clients and their current high spending clients. FTSCLMS was designed to be simple and easy to use and extremely powerful. 

The FREE version of FTSCLMS has several features that allow owners to track their clients. It includes a few of the original items that only FTSCLMS comes with by default. The professional version comes with the ability to track appointments as well as take notes about customers. 

The professional version includes a 1yr warranty with full access to technical support by phone or email, and much, much more. 

FTSCLMS sells for much less than other high priced content management systems with equal or less features.

Installation:
----------------------------------
Extract the files to your web directory.
Chmod _db.php to 777
Chmod .htaccess to 777
Fill out all of your information and submit the form.
Delete install.php
Chmod _db.php to 755
Chmod .htaccess to 755
Enjoy!

Editing Database Connection Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit _db.php for your db settings.
