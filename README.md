To install the software (after updating the code), simply upload it to your site and navigate to /install.php . This should walk you through installing the software.

About the software
-------------------
This software is an outdated version of current software developed by Fast Track Sites ( http://www.fasttracksites.com ). The software in this repo has since been abandoned or rebuilt using better methods. We hope that this software will help new programmers get ideas about reating their own custom systems. If you like the software but want to run a newer version then we suggest you visit our site to purchase an up to date copy if it is available.
