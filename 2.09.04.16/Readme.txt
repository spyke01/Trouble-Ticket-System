Description:
----------------------------------
Fast Track Sites developed the Fast Track Sites Trouble Ticket System (FTSTTS) to allow companies to easily support their products through an easy to use and intuitive interface. FTSTTS was designed to be simple and easy to use while still remaining extremely powerful. 

The FREE version of FTSTTS has several features that allow tickets to be entered and managed. The professional version comes with the ability to create custom categories as well as ban users and create moderators. The professional version also adds email notification alerts when a ticket is entered or updated. 

The professional version includes a 1yr warranty with full access to technical support by phone or email, and much, much more. 

FTSTTS sells for much less than other high priced trouble ticket systems with equal or less features.

Installation:
----------------------------------
Extract the files to your web directory.
Fill out all of your information and submit the form.
Delete install.php
Enjoy!

Editing Database Connection Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit _db.php for your db settings.
